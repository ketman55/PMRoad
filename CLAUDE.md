## Repository Status

This is a fresh repository with no source code implemented yet. The project appears to be named "PMRoad" based on the directory structure.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the development environment and build system have not been established yet. Common setup tasks will likely include:

- Initializing a package manager (npm, yarn, pip, cargo, etc.)
- Setting up a build system and development scripts
- Configuring linting and formatting tools
- Establishing testing frameworks

## Project Structure

The project structure has not been established yet. Once source code is added, this section should be updated with:

- Main application entry points
- Directory organization
- Key architectural patterns
- Important configuration files

## Notes for Claude Code

- This repository is in its initial state
- No specific development commands or build processes have been configured
- Architecture and patterns should be established as the codebase grows
- Update this file as the project structure becomes more defined
